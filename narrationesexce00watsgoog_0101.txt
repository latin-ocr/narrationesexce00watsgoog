AFTER the death of Alexander, his ge·
nerals divide againstone another, not consid·
ering that each should take his portion of the
spoil. Alexander did not designate any suc·
cessor3 he left a son under age, a wisela
pregnancy, and a natural brother of a feeble
and timid character, all of whom, even ro
Olympias his mother, were extenninated.
ln short, alter twenty-three years bloody wars.
the empire of Alexander was divide-d into forr l
great monarchieS, to wit, l'gypt, Macedonia.
Syria and Thrace, which last was soon after
subdivided into several little states. Ι

ln the space os about two hundred and fisa· '
years these states were successirely ruined
by a power whom Greece and Asia were
>then far froin fearing and they became at last
nothing more than mere provinces of the Ro·
man Republic.

That part of Syria which lay beyond the Eo·
ph rates was the only :egion which did not sul·
fer the general invasion. It forins a separate
kingdom under thenanre of Parthia.
