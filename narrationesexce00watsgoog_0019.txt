(Ant. Hist. book 1.)

'l'o cyrus succeeded Cambyseshissoo, aviolent
and cruel prince, who caused smerdis his brother
to be killed upon vain suspicions. He died after a
“ t³tlll³;'t¹llttzt⁸lllhtultellsslt‘l'ttsst
fall. The reign of this priuos is celebrated for hio
'conquestu over Egypt,² A. C. 525.

After the death of cambyses, one of the Magi,
invaded the throne, by making himself pass for
smerdis to whom he hadagreat resemblance. But
the impostore was soon discovered. Seven of the
principal Persian lords conspired against him, kill-
ed him, and p'roclaimed Darius, the son of Hystas-
pes, one among themselves, king. Darius had uo
subjectsmore zealous that his own competitura. A
very striking proof of it is what Zopyrus did to re-
store Babylon2 again into his power. ’
