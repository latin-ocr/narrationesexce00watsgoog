ir is ι ptiofui loct, that almost all the rnioor
aorhors which ere put into the hands of children to
give them aknowledge of the Latio lsngoage, are
either riotple in the extreme, or deboring in their
teodency to the better affections of the heart, aod
subveroire ol propriety of manners.

With a view to remedy the evilsdeplored, 1 hs've
introduced into my seminam, Mr. L'Hornond's
“ Epitorne Historiae Sacrae,” as every way calculo·
ted to instruct children in Latio, ond at the same
timeto conrey to their understanding useful and
interesting truths. Ass subsequeot book 1 heve
introduced ‘¹ De Viris illustribus urbis Romae,”
which, in point of Latinity, style and authenticity,
appears to my view superior to those Roman wri-
tetsto whom it is now used as o substitute. “ Nor·
rationes Excerptae,” as fur as roy examinetion hos
extended. appears to merit much, and will hare its
place in the course of instruction.

1 stodor approve of two elementary books en·
titled‘1Epitmne Historiae Socrd’ sod ‘⁴ De Viris
illustribus urhis Romae‚’' for the following reasons :
The nestness and purity of the Latin, which bynu
metus characterizo the Selectae ἑ Veteri, now
commonly used3 the brief sod simple structore of
the sentences t the proper. omission os appendices,
vocabularies, translations, &c which, instead ot
facilitaoog the progrerr of boys, only cherish sdis-
posilion for telleneu. =
